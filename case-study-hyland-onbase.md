### The Challenge

Enterprise organizations using both Hyland OnBase and Salesforce faced a persistent problem: users had to constantly switch between applications to manage documents and customer records. This context switching created inefficiencies, increased error rates, and slowed down critical business processes.

Sales teams couldn't quickly access customer contracts. Service agents struggled to retrieve supporting documentation. The disconnect between content management and CRM was costing organizations time and money.

### The Approach

Working with Hyland's product team, I led the UX design effort to create a native Salesforce integration that would feel seamless—as if OnBase capabilities were built into Salesforce from the start.

**Discovery & Research**
- Conducted user interviews across Financial Services, Healthcare, and Retail sectors
- Mapped existing workflows to identify friction points
- Analyzed Salesforce Lightning design patterns to ensure native feel

**Design Principles**
1. **Zero context switching** — Users should never leave Salesforce to manage documents
2. **Intelligent automation** — Reduce manual work through smart field mapping
3. **Flexible administration** — Empower admins to configure without code

### The Solution

The Hyland OnBase Integration for Salesforce delivers enterprise content management directly within Salesforce records:

**Drag-and-Drop Document Management**
Users can drag files directly onto Salesforce records, automatically storing them in OnBase with proper indexing and retention policies applied.

**Intelligent Field Mapping**
Salesforce field values automatically map to OnBase keywords, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring documents are properly categorized from the moment they're uploaded.

**Unified Search**
Search and retrieve enterprise content from OnBase without leaving Salesforce. Results appear in a familiar grid view that integrates naturally with the Lightning experience.

**Out-of-Box Configuration**
Administrators can configure the integration through a visual interface—no custom API development required. This dramatically reduces implementation time and total cost of ownership.

### Technical Integration

The solution leverages:
- Hyland Identity Provider for secure authentication
- Hyland API Server for reliable data exchange
- IIS web application for seamless communication
- OnBase Foundation Enhancement Pack 2+ compatibility

**Salesforce Compatibility:**
- Sales Cloud & Service Cloud
- Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Force.com, and Developer editions
- Full Lightning Experience support

### Results

The integration is now available on the Salesforce AppExchange, serving enterprise customers across three key industries:

**Financial Services**
- Streamlined loan document management
- Faster customer onboarding
- Improved compliance documentation

**Healthcare & Life Sciences**
- Unified patient record access
- Simplified claims processing
- Better care coordination

**Retail**
- Centralized vendor documentation
- Efficient contract management
- Improved supplier relationships

### Key Metrics

- **$20/user/month** starting price point for enterprise value
- **25+ user** implementations across major enterprises
- **3 industries** served with tailored configurations
- **Zero custom code** required for standard implementations
