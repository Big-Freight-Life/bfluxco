            <h2 class="section-label">Why this capability exists</h2>
            <div class="service-content">
                <p class="lead">Generative AI expands what systems can do—but also what can go wrong.</p>
                <p>As systems grow more complex, cause and effect become harder to see. AI decisions ripple across workflows, data, and roles—often in ways teams don't anticipate until it's too late. Without structure, intelligence becomes opaque. Trust erodes quickly when people don't understand why a system behaves the way it does.</p>
                <p class="highlight">Gen AI architecture exists to make intelligence understandable, governable, and safe to scale.</p>

    <!-- Approach Section -->
    <section class="service-section bg-gray-50">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2 class="section-label">How I approach it</h2>
            <div class="service-content">
                <p class="lead">I design AI as part of the product—not an add-on.</p>
                <p>That means treating intelligence as a system with clear roles, limits, and feedback loops. Every GenAI system answers three fundamental questions:</p>
                <ul class="service-questions">
                    <li>What can the AI do?</li>
                    <li>What must it never do?</li>
                    <li>When should a human be involved?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To support this, I design three tightly connected layers: agents, models of behavior, and conversation.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="service-content">
                <p class="lead">I design digital twins as living models of system behavior.</p>
                <p>They represent:</p>
                <ul class="service-list">
                    <li>Workflows and dependencies</li>
                    <li>Decision points and failure states</li>
                    <li>Temporal change—not just static structure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These models allow teams to simulate outcomes, test assumptions, and understand downstream effects before committing to change. Digital twins create visibility where intuition alone is no longer sufficient.</p>
                <p class="highlight">They are essential for designing AI systems that evolve safely over time.</p>

                <p>Poorly designed conversational experiences create confusion, false confidence, and frustration. Well-designed ones create clarity, trust, and shared understanding.</p>
                <p>I treat conversation as a structured system, not a personality layer.</p>
                <p>That includes:</p>
